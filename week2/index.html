                            What’s it like to be the strongest person on the planet? If you answered that it’d be a boring depressing state of existential dread, then you’d empathize with the hero of One Punch Man.
                        One Punch Man is a superhero anime based on the Manga of the same name that combines action, comedy, and satire while spoofing many of the tropes endemic in the genre. The concept seems ingeniously simple. The hero, Saitama, is so strong he can defeat any opponent with one punch. Unfortunately, he’s become dissatisfied, as there’s nobody left to challenge him.
                        Most superhero stories have their characters gain their motivation through a personal tragedy. Take Bruce Wayne, who avenges his parent’s death by becoming Batman. One Punch Man doesn’t have that one defining moment. Even his origin story is lackluster, as he didn’t gain his special power through mutations, genetics, or even wealth. He did it through a regimen of physical training that seems disappointingly commonplace. In line with his humble apotheosis, he doesn’t look the part of a superhero either, appearing more like an anime Lex Luthor than Superman. His baldness even becomes used in a gag as a group of thugs called Paradisers all have shaven heads and people mistake Saitama for one of them.
                        Saitama’s interests are hilariously banal. He’s more interested in making it in time for a market sale than he is in beating a diabolical villain. He does possess a general sense of right and wrong, so anyone who messes with the city he lives in gets a beating. But there’s no overbearing obsession or archvillain that pushes him to become stronger.
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            Villain monologues abound with each episode as they draw on anime tropes. Every nefarious being feels like they’re a victim, seeking justice by punishing a world that has wronged them. Before they drone on too long, Saitama shuts them up. He has no time for foreplay and wants to get to the fight itself, hoping someone will give him a worthy match. It always ends in disappointment with that titular one punch being enough to defeat the foe no matter how gargantuan or nasty they appear. The bigger they are, the more chunks of flesh and blood they become.
